# Mini Dashboard using Genesys Cloud API

## Objective
Create a simple web-based dashboard that:
- Authenticates a user via Genesys Cloud OAuth (Client Credentials)
- Fetches and displays a list of active users in the organization
- Displays each userâ€™s:
  - Name
  - Presence status (e.g., Available, Busy, Offline)
  - Email

### Bonus Objectives (Optional):
- Filter users by presence status by adding a dropdown or buttons to filter users by presence (Available, Away, Offline, etc.).
- Re-fetch presence data by adding a "Refresh" button.
- Add error handling (e.g. expired token, API errors).

## Requirements
- Authentication
  - Use OAuth 2.0 with Genesys Cloud (Client Credentials).
  - After login, store the access token and use it in API calls (if using the native fetch call).
- API Usage
  - Use the `/api/v2/users` endpoint to list users.
  - Use `/api/v2/users/{userId}/presences/purecloud` to fetch presence info for each user.
  - Use Authorization: `Bearer {token}` in headers (if using the native fetch call).

## What This Tests
- REST APIs and headers usage.
- OAuth 2.0 knowledge.
- JavaScript async/await or Promises.
- DOM manipulation and user interaction.
- Time and scope management under pressure.

## Tools Allowed
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS only.
- You may use browser DevTools or Postman for testing.
- No back-end server needed.
- You may also use the Genesys Cloud Platform API Client JavaScript SDK for ease of access to Genesys Cloud API via direct use in browser script. Use
the latest version:
  ```
  https://sdk-cdn.mypurecloud.com/javascript/latest/purecloud-platform-client-v2.min.js
  ```

> :bulb: The GitHub repository of the SDK is located [here](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/platform-client-sdk-javascript).

## Notes
- You may research things in the browser. Chatbots are **prohibited**.
- Client Credentials will be provided.
